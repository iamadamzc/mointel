# Thread: Research Pipeline

**Owns what the desk knows and what it pays to know it.** Evidence collection,
source resolution, the interpreter, dossier quality, and the OpenAI bill.

Last worked: **2026-08-21**. Written up 2026-08-23.

## Why this is its own thread

Every one of these arrived looking like a production incident and was actually a
research-pipeline decision about cost:

| Date | What happened |
| --- | --- |
| 2026-08-18 | 403 research jobs in a day, >12M input tokens — duplicate recovery and qualification work |
| 2026-08-19 | Interpreter dead on an empty OpenAI balance; diagnosis cost a live API probe |
| 2026-08-20 | 6.68M input tokens drained the balance again |
| 2026-08-21 | Whole Top 12 dark from 04:00–08:00 ET; 58 failed jobs across 21 tickers, 112 model calls, 0 tokens |

Ops kept absorbing these. The fix is always in `lib/research/`.

## Scope

- `lib/research/` — queue, retry policy, provider errors, interpreter
- Source resolution and catalyst collection; the resolver-first path and the
  urgent first-qualification path for a newly qualifying Top-12 name
- Dossier grading and honesty: `UNKNOWN` and `PARTIAL` are real verdicts, not
  failures
- Model selection and token budget

[../RESEARCH-MILESTONE-PLAN.md](../RESEARCH-MILESTONE-PLAN.md).

## Not this thread

- Deploying → [ops.md](ops.md)
- How dossiers are *presented* → [design.md](design.md)
- **The market archive and the market-structure question** →
  [rnd.md](rnd.md). Split out 2026-08-23: this thread generates incidents, and a
  thread owning both an incident stream and an open research question will only
  ever work on the incidents. This thread's job is that the pipeline produces
  honest catalyst grades at a defensible cost. What those grades *mean* is R&D.

## State as of 2026-08-21

Research is running normally after a manual recovery at 08:11 ET. Seven of the
board's twelve names carried a fresh grade within minutes; IBG recovered on its
own and the two failures around the release were the credit refresh propagating.

Token ceiling is now **10M** (up from 4M on the 19th).

Diagnosis of the 21st took a single query, because `372f5eb` records
`credit_balance_exhausted` rather than a bare `HTTP 429`. That was worth it.

Recovery was done **by criteria, never by ticker name** — `last_error LIKE 'HTTP
429%'` **and** on today's Top 12 or focus list **and** no analysis today. Seven
released, twenty-one obsolete movers correctly left blocked. Repeat that pattern
if it happens again.

## Open items

**1. Billing-class failures should not consume the retry budget.** This is the
one concrete piece of unfinished code in the project.

`evaluateRetry` in [`../../lib/research/retry.ts`](../../lib/research/retry.ts)
releases a blocked ticker only when the *evidence fingerprint* changes. A
billing failure does not change evidence, so a name that fails three times on an
empty balance stays hard-blocked after you top up — and the whole board needs a
manual release.

`BILLING_ERROR_CODES` already exists in
[`../../lib/research/providerError.ts`](../../lib/research/providerError.ts) and
tags these correctly. Excluding billing-class failures from the attempt count
makes a top-up self-healing.

**Done 2026-08-23 in `2433470`** — committed, not yet deployed. Billing failures
back off and record but never become terminal, so a top-up heals the board on
its own; backoff is capped at fifteen minutes so an exempt failure cannot
schedule a name past the close. Hand to Ops for the next deploy.

Worth doing next, and deliberately not built here: **the cooldown is per-ticker
when the fact is global.** "The account is empty" is one truth, and twenty-one
tickers each discovering it separately is twenty-one probes for one answer. A
single global gate would be strictly better.

**2. Interpreter tiering was designed but never exercised.** `Terra` is the
default full research model. The abstraction was deliberately preserved so `Sol`
could take difficult or conflicting dossiers and `Luna` could do low-cost change
detection. Nothing routes to them today, and cheap change detection is the
obvious lever on a 6M-token day.

**3. `RESEARCH_RESOLVER_SEARCH_CONTEXT` stays at its current default.** Low-context
resolver searches were explicitly not enabled. Do not turn them on without
asking.

## Working rules

- **Facts come from deterministic parsing; the model only interprets.** Never
  fabricate a classification to fill a gap — `UNKNOWN`/`PARTIAL` with provenance
  instead.
- **Shares outstanding is not float. Market cap is not float.** Unknown float
  stays unknown.
- **Credentials stay worker-side.** `tests/security.test.ts` enforces this.
- Cost is a completion criterion, not an afterthought: job count, model calls
  and tokens are part of "done".
